Or did he\\u2026\\n In either case,\\n he should have wanted to get rid of\\n the recommendation letter that he brought\\u2026\\n Why would he just get rid of the old recommendation letter?\\n This is where he took his own life\\u2026?\\n It seems that they\\u2019ve already collected the remains.\\n It\\u2019s a job done by the Anbu Black Ops\\u2026\\n They don\\u2019t leave anything behind.\\n Everyone, come over here!\\n Look, the tree is burned on both sides!\\n The Paper Bombs exploded\\u2026\\n There should be burned marks.\\n The fact that it\\u2019s on both sides is the problem!\\n I see. If it were just a suicide bomb,\\n it wouldn\\u2019t have left marks on both sides.\\n There would have to be at least two explosions\\n to leave this kind of burn marks.\\n But according to the Anbu Black Ops,\\n he exploded the Paper Bombs that were wrapped around his body.\\n But no one saw him at the moment of the explosion\\u2026\\n There may be Anbu Black Ops,\\n but they\\u2019d still need to dodge the explosion.\\n This one\\u2019s burned on both sides too\\u2026\\n Same on this tree too.\\n Probably\\u2026\\n First, the Paper Bombs that were placed on\\n the trees in the surrounding area were blown up\\u2026\\n Then there was a huge explosion in the center.\\n If he had set off the explosions close to each other,\\n then it\\u2019s possible to perceive it as one explosion!\\n I see\\u2026\\n But in order to do that,\\n he would have needed to set up some sort of trick before hand.\\n Didn't Genno take his life\\n after being cornered by the Anbu Black Ops?\\n What if they didn't catch up to him,\\n but rather, he let them catch up to him?\\n So you\\u2019re saying that he was running away\\n planning to let them catch up to him here?!\\n It\\u2019s not impossible\\u2026\\n If that is the case\\u2026\\n It\\u2019s possible that he could have laid other traps\\n Could it be that\\u2026\\n the fact he killed himself with the Paper Bombs is also\\u2026\\n It\\u2019s done. They said you could come in.\\n Y-Yeah.\\n It\\u2019s impossible.\\n Didn\\u2019t the Anbu Black Ops make sure with their own eyes\\u2026?\\n Yeah.\\n There's no point in telling me to check out the body.\\n I\\u2019m not a Medical Ninja.\\n What should I check and how should I do it\\u2026?\\n Sakura\\u2026\\n This man\\u2026 He snuck in as a carpenter right?\\n That\\u2019s right.

Shadow Possession Jutsu should have stopped him from moving, but\\u2026\\n Naruto!\\n Naruto! Hey, get yourself together!\\n What a drag this guy is!\\n Naruto!\\n Now, let me feel it\\u2026!\\n Oh no!\\n Stop right there!\\n Tomorrow\\u2019s the final round!\\n There\\u2019s no need to rush like this!\\n Or do you just want to stay here starting today?\\n Don\\u2019t leave me alone!\\n I\\u2019m not bleeding, but it hurts a lot right here.\\n What\\u2026am I?!\\n I will\\u2026kill you all without a fail.\\n Just wait.\\n One!

What do you mean?\\n In other words...\\n what I mean is I had to know if it was you,\\n or one of us Shinobi\\u2026 who was being targeted.\\n We haven't heard anything about you being targeted by Ninjas.\\n The content of the request was supposed to just be\\n protection from gangs, thieves, and the like\\u2026\\n This is a mission with a B rank or higher.\\n The request was supposed to be\\n for backup protection until you finished building your bridge\\u2026\\n If our enemies were to be Ninjas,\\n the mission would've been estimated without question\\n as an expensive  \\\"B Rank\\\"  mission.\\n It appears there's some kind of good reason for this,\\n but being lied to in the request won't do.\\n This is beyond the scope of our mission.\\n This mission is too soon for us\\u2026\\n Let's give it up!\\n We need an anesthetic to open Naruto's wound\\n and get out the poisoned blood\\u2026\\n We have to return to the village and take him to a doctor\\u2026\\n Hmmm\\u2026\\n Hm? What...?!\\n This sure is a burden!\\n Since we need to treat Naruto's wound, shall we go back to the village\\u2026?\\n Huh!\\n Oh!\\n Why am I so different?!\\n Why's it always me\\u2026 Darn it!\\n Naruto!

Such a twisted kind of love.\\n Love?\\n Don\\u2019t measure me by your standards.\\n Family, huh\\u2026\\n Let me tell you what kind of ties I have to my family.\\n They\\u2019re ties of hatred, ties of murderous intent\\u2026\\n My family\\u2019s just lumps of flesh.\\n Nourished with the life of my mother,\\n I was crafted as the ultimate masterpiece of the village\\u2026\\n The Kazekage\\u2019s child.\\n I was taught by my father the innermost secrets of the Shinobi\\u2026\\n spoiled, over-protected, and left on my own.\\n And I thought that was love\\u2026\\n Until that incident happened.\\n That incident\\u2026?!\\n What are you talking about?\\n Just what happened?!\\n In the six years since the time when I was 6 years old\\u2026\\n My real father has tried to assassinate me more times than I can count!\\n But I thought you just said that your father spoiled you\\u2026\\n What\\u2019s going on here?\\n Those who are too strong are apt to become feared.\\n Born through the Jutsu, my mind was unstable\\u2026\\n I guess the idiots in my village\\n finally realized that I had emotional problems\\u2026\\n For my father, Kazekage,\\n at the same time I was the ultimate weapon for the village,\\n I was also a dangerous, fearsome presence.\\n It seems I was labeled a dangerous figure as soon as I turned six.\\n And I was treated politely simply because I was feared.\\n To them, now I\\u2019m just a relic of the past that they want to see disappear.\\n So what did I have in this life, why did I keep living?\\n When I asked myself that, I couldn\\u2019t find the answer.\\n But, as long as you\\u2019re alive, you need a reason\\u2026\\n If you don\\u2019t have one, it\\u2019s just the same as being dead.\\n What\\u2019s this guy saying?\\n I\\u2026can understand that\\u2026\\n He\\u2026is the same as me.\\n So this is the answer I came to\\u2026\\n I am living in order to kill human beings other than myself.\\n After living in the fear of never knowing when I might be murdered,\\n finally I became calm.\\n By killing assassins, I finally comprehended the reason why I live\\u2026\\n I live fighting for only myself and loving myself\\u2026\\n And if I see that all other people in this world exist\\n only to make me realize that,\\n there could be no world more wonderful.\\n And as long as there are others to kill\\n who can make me feel this happiness to be alive,\\n I will never disappear.\\n W-What\\u2019s this freak talking about\\u2026?\\n He\\u2019s real gone!\\n I was also alone\\u2026\\n And suffered \\u2018cause I didn\\u2019t know why I was alive\\u2026\\n But Iruka Sensei recognized me for who I was\\u2026\\n and that was the first time I realized why I lived\\u2026\\n But this guy\\u2026 this guy grew up alone.\\n And he ony feels alive when he kills other people.\\n H-How can there be someone like this?\\n The worlds we live in are too different\\u2026!\\n There\\u2019s no way\\u2026 that I can beat a guy like this!\\n W-What\\u2019s wrong, Naruto?\\n What?

What do you mean?\\n In other words...\\n what I mean is I had to know if it was you,\\n or one of us Shinobi\\u2026 who was being targeted.\\n We haven't heard anything about you being targeted by Ninjas.\\n The content of the request was supposed to just be\\n protection from gangs, thieves, and the like\\u2026\\n This is a mission with a B rank or higher.\\n The request was supposed to be\\n for backup protection until you finished building your bridge\\u2026\\n If our enemies were to be Ninjas,\\n the mission would've been estimated without question\\n as an expensive  \\\"B Rank\\\"  mission.\\n It appears there's some kind of good reason for this,\\n but being lied to in the request won't do.\\n This is beyond the scope of our mission.\\n This mission is too soon for us\\u2026\\n Let's give it up!\\n We need an anesthetic to open Naruto's wound\\n and get out the poisoned blood\\u2026\\n We have to return to the village and take him to a doctor\\u2026\\n Hmmm\\u2026\\n Hm? What...?!\\n This sure is a burden!\\n Since we need to treat Naruto's wound, shall we go back to the village\\u2026?\\n Huh!\\n Oh!\\n Why am I so different?!\\n Why's it always me\\u2026 Darn it!\\n Naruto! What're you doing?!\\n I should be getting stronger\\u2026\\n Here I'm steadily carrying out missions and\\n doing special-skill training by myself every day\\u2026\\n I'll never get into another situation from which I'll have to be rescued.\\n I'll never be afraid or a be a coward\\u2026\\n I won't lose to Sasuke\\u2026\\n I'm going to swear on the pain of my left hand!\\n I'll protect you, old man\\u2026 with this Kunai knife!!\\n The mission continues!!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n It's all well and good to rid yourself of the poisoned blood,\\n but any more than that and you'll bleed to death.\\n Things will get hairy if you don't stop the bleeding quick... Seriously!\\n Yikes!\\n Argh! No! No!\\n I can't die like this, I say!\\n Show me your hand.\\n Nooo! Help me!!\\n Naruto!\\n You're really self-abusive, aren't you!\\n That's masochistic!\\n The wound is\\u2026\\n already starting to heal\\u2026\\n Um\\u2026um\\u2026\\n Am I okay? You look awfully serious\\u2026\\n Well\\u2026You should be okay.\\n Is it\\u2026the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox\\u2026?\\n Did you say you failed?!\\n I paid a lot of money to hire you guys\\n because you said you were once hot-shot Ninjas!\\n Stop your darned grumbling\\u2026!!\\n Next time, I'll kill him with this\\u2026 head chopper!\\n I-It's really okay, right?!\\n It seems that the enemy has hired good Ninjas\\u2026\\n On top of that, a tightened guard on account of the Demon Brothers' failure\\n means that it won't be easy\\u2026\\n Just who do you think I am?!\\n This Zabuza Momochi, who is called the demon of\\u2026\\n the Hidden Mist!!\\n We've finally landed ashore in the Land of the Waves.\\n The guys before were all well and good,\\n but there should be even stronger guys lying in wait.\\n Okay!

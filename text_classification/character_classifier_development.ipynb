This is a sealing technique that is characteristic of the Uzumaki clan.[1] Users produce chains made out of their own chakra, which typically emerge from their torso. Users control the chains as they extend outwards from their body, most commonly to wrap around targets and restrain them.[2] The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the Nine-Tails would struggle to destroy them.[1] In the anime, in addition to physically binding targets, the chains are said to neutralise their target by binding and nullifying their chakra.[3] Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.[4]\\n\\nThe chains creating a barrier.The chains binding the Nine-Tails within Kushina's subconscious.1/2\\nA barrier can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: Kushina Uzumaki creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the Third Hokage from entering it.[5] Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides. When she was the Nine-Tails' jinch\\u016briki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,[6] and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.[1] After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, Naruto Uzumaki, allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.[2]\\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Karin awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a wooden opponent. Orochimaru labels this the same ability as Kushina possessed,[7] but Jin no Sho describes it only as a \\\"glimpse\\\" of Kushina's Adamantine Sealing Chains.[1]\\n\\nSee Also[]\\nBeast Sealing Technique\\nDemonic Statue Chains\\nReferences[]\\n\\n\\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Jin no Sho, page 253\\n\\n\\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 498\\n\\n\\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\\u016bden episode 408\\n\\n\\u2191 Naruto chapter 503\\n\\n\\u2191 Naruto chapter 504\\n\\n\\u2191 Naruto chapter 501\\n\\n\\u2191 Naruto chapter 663\",\n          \"Human Bullet Tank. This is a \\\"showy\\\" taijutsu unique to members of the Akimichi clan.[1] After growing in size with the Multi-Size Technique, the Akimichi tucks themselves into a ball and rolls towards a target.[2] Due to their increased weight and the force of their rotation, most obstacles are pulverised upon contact. Users can take advantage of the surrounding environment to launch themselves into the air,[1] increasing the damage when they fall back to the ground. The speed at which they spin has the added benefit of rendering most attacks ineffective against them.[2] But the ball's speed also makes it difficult to turn, forcing users to stop spinning entirely if they want to make significant changes in direction and thus leaving them vulnerable while they do.[3]\\nHow the Human Bullet Tank is used depends on what form the Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique takes. In Part I, when Ch\\u014dji Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique makes him very round, he retracts his arms, legs, and head into his body so that they don't get in the way while he rolls; because his head is submerged in his bulk, this also makes him immune to external sounds.[3] In Part II, when Ch\\u014dji's Multi-Size Technique simply makes him large, he folds his legs to his chest and locks his arms around them.[4]\",\n          \"Snake Spying Technique.

This is a sealing technique that is characteristic of the Uzumaki clan.[1] Users produce chains made out of their own chakra, which typically emerge from their torso.

When she was the Nine-Tails' jinch\\u016briki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,[6] and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.[1] After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, Naruto Uzumaki, allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.[2]\\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Karin awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a wooden opponent.

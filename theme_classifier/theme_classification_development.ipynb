Behind that tree.\\n It\\u2019s here!\\n I see\\u2026 The Old Man Genno used this hole to get away.\\n He camouflaged it well.\\n If it wasn\\u2019t for the Byakugan, we would have missed it.\\n Not only that\\u2026\\n This hole is made so that it closes naturally by the weight of the earth.\\n If we came here another day later,\\n it would have been extremely difficult to find,\\n even with the Byakugan.\\n And to prove that,\\n you can barely see any sign of an entrance to this hole.\\n Akamaru, can you follow his scent?\\n He\\u2019s even got getting rid of his smell covered\\u2026\\n Where could he have gone?\\n Our conclusion is that\\u2026\\n Old Man Genno is still alive\\n and there's a possibility that he's hiding in Leaf Village.\\n He got cornered, and faked his own suicide,\\n and stole the plans so that he could\\u2026\\n make all of us turn our eyes outside of the village.\\n He could have already known about the big practice run\\n in the Hidden Waterfall Village and used that to his advantage.\\n B-But the Anbu Black Ops started to mark Genno because\\n they happened to find out that his letter of recommendation was a fake, right?\\n Was it a coincident\\u2026?\\n Isn\\u2019t it strange that a real letter of recommendation was\\n at the house of the carpenter boss he worked for?\\n Then what is his true goal?\\n If we knew the answer to that, we wouldn\\u2019t be struggling so much\\u2026\\n Shikamaru!\\n The only thing I can say now is\\u2026\\n The number of Shinobi in this village currently is at its lowest ever.\\n We only have a bare minimum of us here!\\n And most of their eyes are looking outside of the village.\\n Even if Genno was walking around as he was humming on the streets,\\n no one would suspect anything of him.\\n Did he set a trap in the village?!\\n Could the fact that that he scattered the plans around mean that\\n he\\u2019s already done setting his trap?\\n No, this is just a diversion to turn our eyes.\\n We can\\u2019t leave this place without any security,\\n but we have few people\\u2026\\n Then where do we look?\\n The Academy.\\n The Academy?\\n Why the Academy out of all the important facilities in the village?\\n Out of all the sites Genno worked on,\\n only the Academy\\u2019s repair plan was stolen.\\n It\\u2019s hard to think that it was a coincidence\\n for it to disappear at this timing.\\n Byakugan!\\n Well?\\n There\\u2019s nothing in this room.\\n Then\\u2026move ahead to the next room.\\n Byakugan!\\n Seems like there\\u2019s nothing in this area\\n Can\\u2019t you look at the entire campus at once?\\n And we have Hinata too, you know?\\n That would be possible if we know what the target was,\\n but we\\u2019re looking for something suspicious.\\n We\\u2019ll have to take the basic route.\\n Hey! Wait a minute!\\n You\\u2019re in the way!\\n And there\\u2019s too many\\u2026 people here.\\n Like I said!\\n All I want is for you guys to come outside even just for a moment!\\n Our teacher told us to study on our own in the classroom for today!\\n We can\\u2019t go out of the room!\\n There are no teachers today!\\n So nobody would know if you left the class!\\n We used to skip class when lruka Sensei wasn\\u2019t looking\\n when we were younger.\\n Oh! A delinquent!\\n \\u2013 Delinquent! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Delinquent!\\n We have to check this area!\\n Besides, all the teachers have gone on a mission to protect the village.\\n Why are you guys still here?\\n They must be useless.\\n What did you say?! We\\u2019re also protecting the village too\\u2026\\n Naruto. You\\u2019re wasting time\\n Let\\u2019s crush them!\\n What?\\n The Expansion Jutsu!\\n We\\u2019re going to tell on you to our teacher!\\n Yeah, do as you please!\\n Idiot!\\n Let\\u2019s practice our Kunai Knives.\\n Sounds good.\\n It doesn\\u2019t seem like there\\u2019s anything suspicious\\u2026\\n Hurry up!\\n Wait!\\n Come on. I\\u2019m begging you to leave!\\n Naruto!\\n Where did those kids from the next classroom go?\\n I don\\u2019t know\\u2026\\n They were going to practice their Kunai Knives.\\n That\\u2019s what they were saying.\\n Oh, yeah, yeah. That\\u2019s right.\\n They\\u2019re practicing their Kunai Knives in a place like that?\\n I\\u2019ll do next.\\n Ok. Do your best!\\n Do it!\\n Yeah!\\n Oh, so close.\\n They really are practicing\\u2026\\n When we were students at the Academy,\\n we used to skip class and come here.\\n The teacher\\u2019s couldn\\u2019t find us here, it really was great!\\n I read comic books, and took naps\\u2026\\n That\\u2019s right, I ate potato chips.\\n Well, that\\u2019s no good!\\n You can learn something from those kids.\\n Even if the teachers doesn\\u2019t see you,\\n you should still commit to your practice!\\n They\\u2019re true models of students!\\n Wonderful! I\\u2019m excited! I\\u2019m moved!\\n I\\u2019d like to take class with them!\\n We wouldn\\u2019t want to interrupt. Let\\u2019s go.\\n Yeah\\u2026\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n What?\\n Did they have that before?\\n I\\u2019m going to get this one!\\n Ouch!\\n I had it!\\n It seems pretty new.\\n Genno could have made it\\u2026\\n I-I\\u2019m going to get Neji or Hinata!\\n You guys get out of the way.\\n You\\u2019re getting in the way of our practice.\\n O-Oh I\\u2019m sorry!\\n I\\u2019m next!\\n Byakugan!\\n It\\u2019s a Paper Bomb! lt\\u2019s hidden behind the wall!\\n What, inside the wall?!\\n It\\u2019s completely hidden inside the wall.\\n But then how do you detonate it\\u2026?\\n Oh, there she is.\\n Hey! Hinata!\\n Naruto.\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n Hinata, go out with me!\\n Wh-What are you saying at a time like this?!\\n Huh?\\n I-I don't know\\u2026 Go out with you?\\n You won\\u2019t?\\n I-I\\u2019m not necessarily saying no\\u2026\\n Then I\\u2019ll just ask Neji then. See you later!\\n What?\\n There\\u2019s a thin thread attached to the Paper Bomb.\\n A thread?\\n It\\u2019s probably a special thread used to ignite it.\\n He's probably is going to detonate it from a distance\\u2026\\n Where is that thread connected to?!\\n It goes around the classroom and\\u2026\\n It goes outside\\u2026 towards the training hall\\u2026?\\n There\\u2019s a log standing\\u2026\\n This\\u2026 Could it be?!\\n Neji! Come with me for a second!\\n What is it! We\\u2019re in the middle of something\\u2026\\n Actually there\\u2019s a strange log standing in the training hall over there.\\n We wanted him to check it.\\n That\\u2019s the triggering device!\\n Huh?\\n Try loosening up your shoulders and then throw it.\\n Shut up.\\n All right, I\\u2019m up next.\\n There should be a target on the log.\\n Yeah, there is.\\n The center of the target is the triggering device!\\n When a Kunai Knife hits the center\\u2026\\n the device will activate\\u2026\\n And the Academy will explode!\\n So close!\\n If you focus, you\\u2019ll hit the target.\\n All right, I\\u2019m going to hit this time.\\n Focus\\u2026\\n And target!\\n Don\\u2019t let anybody hit the target!\\n All right, I hit the target!\\n You did it!\\n Oh?\\n The tip is cracked. You always have to take care of your tools.\\n Damn, I thought that I hit the target.\\n This way! Behind there!\\n All right\\u2026 I\\u2019m going to hit it for sure!\\n That\\u2019s the spirit!\\n This looks good!\\n This time I\\u2019m going to hit it!\\n Bushy Brow!\\n Stop it, Lee!\\n What?\\n Oh, did I scare you?\\n I\\u2019m sorry. I just dropped my Ninja tool\\u2026 Here.\\n Bushy Brow, you did it!\\n I had the target!\\n Why did you get in the way?!\\n Be quiet! lf that had hit the target,\\n the Academy would have exploded!\\n What\\u2026?\\n For real?\\n A triggering device in here\\u2026huh?\\n When something hits the center, the Academy explodes.\\n So there hasn\\u2019t been anyone who\\u2019s been able to hit the center.\\n We really were lucky.\\n We were lucky, huh?\\n So who started to practice throwing their Kunai-Knife here?\\n Who? Who was it?\\n Somebody told us that we'd be praised\\n if we got better at Kunai-Knife throwing in secret from the teachers.\\n \\\"in secret from from the teachers\\u2026\\\"\\n Whoever must\\u2019ve used Genjutsu to make them think that.\\n It must be Genno.\\n What happened?\\n W-Well\\u2026 There's more than one thread coming out of the triggering device.\\n Is that true Hinata?\\n Yeah\\u2026\\n Byakugan!\\n True. There's not just one\\u2026two\\u2026no, three?\\n Where are they connected to?\\n Outside of the academy\\u2026 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNo!\\n Wait! It\\u2019s hard to see from here.\\n U-Umm\\u2026 M-Me too\\u2026\\n Byakugan!\\n Byakugan!\\n I found one.\\n I found one, too\\n Tell us the location.\\n No, wait. The thread splits again.\\n Over here too\\u2026\\n Th-This is\\u2026\\n No\\u2026way\\u2026\\n It can't be\\u2026\\n Hey! What\\u2019s the matter!\\n There\\u2019s Paper Bombs planted all over the village!\\n It\\u2019s not just 10 or 20\\u2026\\n It's countless numbers of them!\\n What?!\\n The Village Hidden in the Leaves is a nest of Paper Bombs!\\n On a checkerboard night\\n when the stardust\\u2019s are rapidly dancing\\n I just can\\u2019t come out and say, \\u201cAh, I don\\u2019t want to go home yet.\\u201d\\n Suggestively\\n Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket\\n The Trombone gradually going off-key\\n While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.\\n But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,\\n I wonder if it\\u2019s from that coke I just drank?\\n \\u2013 Now, the Academy is safe. \\u2013 All right!\\n It\\u2019s too early to feel relieved.\\n If he realizes the Paper Bombs are being deactivated,\\n he might blow up the village by a different method.\\n Then we have to evacuate everyone quickly!\\n \\u2013 Then he'll know what we're doing! \\u2013 That means\\u2026\\n Pretend we don\\u2019t notice anything and get rid of the Paper Bombs.\\n Everyone, get to it at once!\\n \\u2013 Yeah! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Yes.\\n Next time: \\u201cThe Powerful Helper\\u201d\\n\",\n          \"Gaara.\\n Kankuro.\\n Gaara.\\n Primary Lotus!\\n Damn it!

How nostalgic.\\n I used one a lot with puppet games when I was a kid.\\n It can look like a living snake depending on how it\\u2019s controlled.\\n But there\\u2019s no point once it\\u2019s been identified.\\n Though we both use Puppets, compared to mine, it\\u2019s just a kid\\u2019s toy.\\n Go, Gaara.\\n Can I leave it to you?\\n Yeah. I don\\u2019t need your help for this. I\\u2019ll catch up right away.\\n I\\u2019m counting on you.\\n Now, bring it on.

This might take a little time.\\n Suiko, you ambush him here.\\n Draw him into the Reverse Scale Position. Got it?\\n Yeah\\u2026\\n You won\\u2019t get through here.\\n Gaara, fight me.\\n Very well.\\n Bring it.\\n Hey, Shikamaru. How long are we going to stay like this?\\n Shut up. There are many difficulties with ambushes.\\n Right now, Shino, Neji and Hinata are taking on those difficulties for us.\\n What?

Then that means you also knew\\u2026?\\n I was looking into Orochimaru\\u2019s Immortality Jutsu.\\n It seems with that Jutsu,\\n he can\\u2019t reincarnate into the next body for three years.\\n And unable to wait for Sasuke, he just recently reincarnated\\u2026\\n It\\u2019ll be okay for three years from now\\u2026 There is time.\\n That\\u2019s not a lie, is it?!\\n Not a lie, is it?!\\n Nope\\u2026\\n However\\u2026\\n Forget about Sasuke\\u2026\\n Sasuke went to Orochimaru on his own accord.\\n No matter what you do, he won\\u2019t change.\\n I\\u2019ve seen many Shinobi, so I know\\u2026\\n Sasuke is the same kind as Orochimaru.\\n If you\\u2019re thinking about bringing him back, just forget it.\\n That\\u2019s something an arrogant fool would do!\\n He may be nothing to you but he\\u2019s my friend!\\n Would a friend hurt his comrade?!\\n Take a look at your current plight!\\n This is\\u2026!\\n Why? Why would you\\u2026?\\n We were called Sannin together\\u2026\\n Weren\\u2019t we comrades since we were kids?!\\n In every regard, you\\u2019re a foolish guy, Jiraiya\\u2026\\n You lack thought in everything you do.\\n That\\u2019s why you didn\\u2019t notice what I was doing.\\n Can\\u2019t you rethink it, Orochimaru?\\n Absurd!\\n How can you be so stupid?!\\n No matter how much I wanted it\\u2026\\n in the end, there was no way he would come back.\\n After the agony, all that\\u2019s left was my own powerlessness and regret.\\n I don\\u2019t want you to go through the same thing\\u2026\\n If you\\u2019re going to go after Sasuke, then there\\u2019ll be no training.\\n I\\u2019ll get Anbu Black Ops to watch you\\n and depending on the case, prohibit you from leaving the village.\\n You\\u2019re not just an ordinary kid\\u2026\\n You possess the Nine Tail Fox that the Akatsuki is after!\\n This is serious. I'll just have to do that\\u2026\\n if you\\u2019re going to act on your own without listening to what I say.\\n Eventually, you\\u2019re going to have to deal\\n with guys more troublesome than Orochimaru.\\n Give up on Sasuke.\\n Sooner or later this was going to happen.\\n Don\\u2019t suffer anymore! Forget and dismiss him.\\n It\\u2019s not just Jutsu or power\\u2026\\n If you\\u2019re a Shinobi, develop eyes that can make the right judgment.\\n And if you\\u2019re going to live as a Shinobi, become wise.\\n If you remain a fool\\u2026\\n the reality is that it will be tough living in this world.\\n Fine.\\n If that\\u2019s what being wise is\\u2026\\n Then I\\u2019m fine being a fool for life!\\n Even if by myself,\\n I\\u2019ll create even more awesome Jutsu and save Sasuke no matter what!\\n And, and, I\\u2019ll even kick the Akatsuki\\u2019s butt!\\n If someone like you were to do it alone\\u2026\\n the best you\\u2019d be able to come up with\\n would be some stupid erotic Jutsu, anyway.\\n It might somehow work out\\n if you are a big fool and not an ordinary fool\\u2026\\n Be prepared once you\\u2019re out of the hospital,\\n you big fool.\\n See you then.\\n Roger!\\n \\u2013 It\\u2019s been seven years since\\u2026 \\u2013 \\u2026all the members gathered like this.\\n Since Orochimaru left the organization.\\n That Orochimaru has gotten the Sharingan.\\n Itachi\\u2026Your little brother?\\n Don\\u2019t get hasty.

Believe it!\\n There\\'s a problem, sir!\\n Lord Hokage!\\n What is it?\\n Did that Naruto do something again?\\n Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images…\\n And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!\\n Wait!\\n Ha ha…\\n Why should I?\\n Hey, Naruto!\\n How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?\\n The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?\\n Now listen, Naruto.\\n You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.\\n This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!\\n We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!\\n Even those who already passed will take it!\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Sakura Haruno. Here I go…\\n Transform!\\n OK!\\n I did it!\\n Cha!\\n Did you see that, Sasuke?\\n Next, Sasuke Uchiha.\\n Yes.\\n O-OK.\\n Next, Naruto Uzumaki.\\n This is a real pain.\\n And it\\'s all your fault.\\n Like I care!!\\n OK…\\n Good luck, Naruto…\\n Transform!\\n How was it?\\n I call it the \"Sexy Jutsu\"!\\n You fool! Stop making idiotic spells!\\n Darn…\\n Darn…\\n I won\\'t let you go home unless you clean that all up.\\n I don\\'t care…\\n There\\'s nobody home anyway.\\n Naruto...\\n What is it this time?\\n What I meant was…\\n If you clean up all that mess, I\\'ll buy you ramen tonight.\\n Huh?!\\n Yes! I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don\\'t you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I\\'ll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I\\'ll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm…No…\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will…\\n You\\'re so mean!\\n So that\\'s why you took off your goggles…\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no…\\n Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But still… I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn\\'t that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it\\'s practically useless. I can\\'t give him a passing mark.\\n I \\'m a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That\\'s my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I\\'ll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It\\'s that boy. I hear he\\'s the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn\\'t that the boy who is actually…\\n Hey! We\\'re not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn\\'t trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don\\'t have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice…\\n I\\'ll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But…\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents…like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What\\'s the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage\\'s immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto… stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let\\'s see…\\n The first Jutsu is… Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I\\'m no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can\\'t forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use…\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes.

I\\'m gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You\\'re gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn\\'t it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place…\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I\\'m impressed you found this place.\\n I see now…how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait… What\\'s going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don\\'t let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don\\'t do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka\\'s parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn\\'t you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto…\\n Nobody accepts you. That\\'s why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That\\'s why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It\\'s the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why…?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn\\'t a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown… because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn\\'t get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn\\'t that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely…right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I\\'m sorry, Naruto….\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn\\'t have suffered so much.\\n Don\\'t make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He\\'s just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn\\'t you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No… Naruto…isn\\'t…like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I\\'ll take care of you later!\\n I-I won\\'t let you…\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he\\'s ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There\\'s a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens…\\n I\\'ve found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can\\'t be…\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How…\\n did you know I wasn\\'t Iruka…?\\n Because I\\'m Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What\\'s in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I\\'m not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You\\'re the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster…\\n that Fox Spirit, won\\'t take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You\\'re right…\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he\\'s single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He\\'s Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me…\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I\\'ll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don\\'t you try then? I\\'ll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let\\'s see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You\\'ve…\\n Those aren\\'t just images but actual clones! That\\'s an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What\\'s this…?\\n What\\'s the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC\\'mon!\\n Weren\\'t you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that case… I\\'ll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He\\'s really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders…\\n Naruto, come over here. I\\'d like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be bad…\\n There\\'s no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He\\'ll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulations…on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we\\'ll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Naruto…\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you\\'re a Ninja.\\n But I guess I\\'ll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand…\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You\\'re smaller than me and\\n you\\'re saying that you\\'re gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don\\'t care if you are the 3rd Hokage\\'s grandson or not.\\n It\\'s not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you\\'re gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \"My Name Is Konohamaru!\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n'"

You're asking for it!\\n I like stuff like this!\\n A Jonin wouldn't get caught in such a weak booby trap.\\n That's right. You're such an idiot...!\\n I got him, I got him...\\n I-I'm sorry, sir.\\n I tried to stop him, but Naruto did it on his own...\\n It's all good.\\n Get real. ls he really a Jonin?\\n How can I put this?\\n As for my first impression of you guys...?\\n Well, I hate you.\\n Pass or Fail: Survival Test\\n Let's see.\\n First off, let me have you guys introduce yourselves.\\n Introduce ourselves...\\n What should we say?\\n Your likes, dislikes, your future dream, hobbies, things like that!\\n Hey!  Before that, please tell us about yourself.\\n Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.\\n I don't feel like telling you guys about my likes and dislikes.\\n I've never really thought about my future dream...\\n As for my hobbies, I have many.\\n In the end, isn't all we know his name?\\n Yeah.\\n Next is you guys.\\n Let's start with you.\\n My name's Naruto Uzumaki!\\n I like instant ramen,\\n but what I like even more is the ramen from Ichiraku\\n that Iruka Sensei treats me to.\\n What I dislike is the three minutes\\n after pouring hot water in the instant ramen.\\n My hobby is eating and comparing ramen!\\n And my future dream...\\n is to surpass the Hokage!\\n And so I'm going to get the entire village\\n to acknowledge my existence!\\n I see...\\n this kid's grown up in an interesting way.\\n Okay, next.\\n I'm Sakura Haruno.\\n What I like... I mean, who I like is...\\n And, my hobby is, \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI mean...\\n My future dream is...\\n And? What about your dislikes?\\n Naruto!\\n Girls at her age are probably more interested in love\\n than the Ninja Arts.\\n And lastly.\\n My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.\\n I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular.\\n Oh...\\n And...\\n I don't feel like summing up my ambition as just a dream\\n but I do have an ambition!\\n The ambition to restore my clan and without fail...\\n to kill a certain man!\\n He doesn't...\\n mean me, does he?\\n Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.\\n I knew it...\\n Good!\\n The three of you are very distinctive and interesting!\\n We'll have a mission tomorrow!\\n Yes, sir! What kind of mission?\\n First, we'll do what we can do with just four people.\\n What-what-what?!\\n A survival exercise.\\n Survival exercise?\\n Why are we doing an exercise\\n even though this is supposed to be a mission?\\n We've had more than our share of exercises in the Academy!\\n This is no simple exercise.\\n Then... then what kind of exercise is it?\\n Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?\\n Uh, well, if I tell you, I know you'll grow disenchanted.\\n What?\\n Of the twenty-seven graduates,\\n only nine will be recognized as junior ninjas.\\n The remaining eighteen will be sent back to the Academy.\\n In other words, this exercise is an extremely difficult test\\n with a failure rate of 66% or higher!\\n See, see?\\n You got disenchanted!\\n That's crazy!\\n To have suffered that much!\\n T-Then, what was the graduation test for?\\n Oh, that.\\n It was just to select those who have the potential of becoming Genin.\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Well, that's the way it is.\\n I'll be determining whether you pass or fail.\\n Bring your complete set of Ninja tools!\\n We meet at five in the morning.\\n N-No way am I going to be dropped now!\\n I've got to have my strength recognized for real.\\n I'll be separated from Sasuke if I fail this test.\\n This is an exercise of love!\\n Okay! You're dismissed.\\n Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.\\n You'll throw up.\\n Morning.\\n Hi, folks. Good morning!\\n You're late!\\n Well, a black cat crossed my path, you see.\\n Ahem! Oh well...\\n Okay, it's set for 12:00!\\n Today's assignment is to take these bells away from me by noon.\\n Those who can't do it won't get lunch.\\n They'll be tied to that...\\n and I'll eat my lunch before your very eyes.\\n So that was the point...\\n for us not to eat breakfast...\\n But, hold on.\\n Why are there only two bells?\\n There are only two, so at the very least,\\n one will have to go to the logs.\\n That person will be disqualified for failing the mission...\\n and will return to the Academy.\\n It might be one person at the very least,\\n or it could be all three of you.\\n You can use your Shuriken.\\n You won't be able to take the bells unless you come with the intent to kill me.\\n But, that's dangerous, sir!\\n Y-Yeah, that's right!\\n You couldn't even evade a chalkboard eraser!\\n In this world,\\n those who aren't skilled enough tend to complain more.\\n Well, just ignore the loser...\\n Begin when I give the \\\"ready-go\\\" signal.\\n Loser, loser, loser.\\n Don't be so hasty. I didn't say start, yet.\\n No way...!\\n I didn't see him at all.\\n So this is a Jonin.\\n But, that's fine.\\n At least you came with  the intent to kill me.\\n How can I put this...?\\n I feel like I'm finally starting...\\n to like you guys.\\n We're going to start.\\n Ready... start!\\n What do you want to know?\\n I didn't think you just came here to drink tea.\\n The Jonin in Naruto and company's Group Seven...\\n What kind of teacher is he? ls he strict?\\n You mean Kakashi? Does he concern you?\\n I heard a rumor that concerns me.\\n What's this?\\n It's a pass-fail list of the junior ninjas\\n Kakashi has been in charge of up until now.\\n Let me have a look.\\n T-This is...!\\n Fundamentally, ninja must mask their presence and hide.\\n Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...\\n Alright! Let's face off fair and square!\\n Oh?\\n That goof.\\n Say, aren't you a bit off kilter?\\n What's off kilter is your hairstyle!\\n I'll teach you the first Shinobi Battle Jutsu...\\n Taijutsu.\\n Taijutsu...?\\n That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...\\n That being said... he's going to use weapons?\\n Make-Out Paradise\\n What's the matter?\\n Why don't you come at me?\\n But hey... what's with the book?\\n Why do you ask...?\\n It's because I was curious about what happens next.\\n Don't worry.\\n With you guys as opponents,\\n it makes no difference if I'm reading or not.\\n I'm going to rip you apart!\\n Darn! This time a spin kick!\\n Man!\\n Wha--?!\\n Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind multiple times, fool.\\n The way his hands are positioned...\\n Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!\\n No way!\\n With Naruto as his opponent,\\n that's too strong a Ninjutsu no matter how you look at it.\\n That Sign... lt's a fire-style skill.\\n That idiot teacher's doing more than just running around?\\n Naruto, get out of there quick!\\n You'll die!\\n Too late.\\n Leaf Village Secret! Ultimate Taijutsu!\\n One Thousand Years of Death!\\n Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.\\n Those two are idiots.\\n Alright...\\n Even so, isn't that against the rules?\\n What're we supposed to do about his strength?\\n Darn it!\\n It wasn't supposed to be like this.\\n It... can't be!\\n This is more than just a rumor.\\n Kakashi's test might be a bit difficult...\\n Even so, this means absolutely no one has passed...!\\n That's right...\\n Kakashi has never had someone pass.\\n They have all...\\n been annihilated...\\n What's the matter?\\n You won't get lunch if you can't take the bell by noon.\\n I know that, I say.\\n You're not very energetic,\\n considering you said that you'd surpass the Hokage.\\n Darn it! Darn it! I can fight even if I'm hungry.\\n I didn't even have dinner last night.\\n I shouldn't have gone on a diet.\\n I just got a bit careless earlier!\\n Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...\\n But... I've got to take the bell, no matter what.\\n No matter what...\\n I'm... not...\\n turning back now!\\n I'm going to become a Ninja!\\n Security is your greatest enemy!\\n Now for my favorite Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Seven... Narutos?\\n What? They're not just images?\\n Are they all real? The real thing?\\n Not the clone, but the shadow clone, eh.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones!\\n That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n It's the forbidden Jutsu that did in Mizuki.\\n Judging from your ability,\\n that Jutsu should have a one-minute limit.\\n Even if you talk trash,\\n Naruto is Naruto after all is said and done...\\n You still can't beat me with that skill.\\n W-What?! Behind me?!\\n Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind.\\n Right, Kakashi Sensei?\\n Using the Shadow Clone,\\n I had one of them come up\\n from the bottom of the river and sneak behind you!\\n Here's one for that attack on my butt earlier!\\n Naruto, not bad!\\n So... a diversionary tactic, eh?\\n Now... allow me to punch you!\\n What?!\\n The one who got punched was...\\n Naruto?\\n Ouch!\\n You...!\\n You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!\\n You used the Transformation Jutsu to change yourself, didn't you?!\\n It's you!\\n You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.\\n You smell like Kakashi Sensei!\\n The smell of an old guy!\\n Why you--!\\n Hey! For the time being, let's try undoing the Jutsu.\\n If we do that, only the two will remain... so...\\n You should've realized that sooner, you idiot!\\n You're me, you idiot! Just undo the Jutsu!\\n Naruto...\\n You're embarrassing to watch...\\n That was the Substitution Jutsu, you fool.\\n Essentially, it's a skill used to quickly switch one's own body\\n with an object or animal.\\n This makes your enemy think you're being attacked,\\n but then you strike during their unguarded moment.\\n After letting himself get caught by the real Naruto,\\n the Jonin fool switched bodies with one of the clone Narutos.\\n Not only did he make Naruto think he'd been nailed...\\n he used Naruto's own attack on him.\\n A bell?!\\n You really must have been in a hurry.\\n You've dropped a bell!\\n What the heck is this?!\\n Of course it's a trap...\\n H-H-Hey!\\n That jonin doesn't lower his guard even when he's fighting Naruto.\\n The bell!\\n You have to think when using Jutsu.\\n They can be used against you.\\n Also...\\n ...don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool.\\n A Ninja must see through deception!\\n I know that, I say!\\n You know, I'm telling you because you don't get it.\\n Listen up!\\n Your movements are wasteful.\\n Now!\\n He finally dropped his guard!\\n You're so...\\n No way!\\n You jerk Sasuke!\\n You're overdoing it!\\n Darn it!\\n At this rate, there's no way I can beat Kakashi Sensei.\\n But if I don't take the bell...\\n I won't get lunch...\\n No... I'll fail the test!\\n He says a Ninja must see through deception,\\n but I have no idea what that means.\\n How in the world can I take the bell back\\n from Kakashi Sensei?!\\n Next episode:  \\\"You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision\\\"\\n Don't miss my outstanding performance!\\n\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.\\n With its powerful tails,\\n it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.\\n A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.\\n We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!\\n We can't let it get any closer to our village!\\n One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,\\n but died in the process.\\n This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage.\\n Naruto!\\n Why did you do such a thing?!\\n You're really gonna get it this time!\\n I don't care!\\n You know your problem?\\n You can't do the things I do!\\n Only I can do this!\\n I'm better than all of you! Believe it!\\n There's a problem, sir!\\n Lord Hokage!\\n What is it?\\n Did that Naruto do something again?\\n Yes.

Stop making idiotic spells!\\n Darn\\u2026\\n Darn\\u2026\\n I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up.\\n I don't care\\u2026\\n There's nobody home anyway.\\n Naruto...\\n What is it this time?\\n What I meant was\\u2026\\n If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight.\\n Huh?!\\n Yes! I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I'll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will\\u2026\\n You're so mean!\\n So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no\\u2026\\n Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn't that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.\\n I 'm a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That's my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I'll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026\\n Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don't have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026\\n I'll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But\\u2026\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What's the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let's see\\u2026\\n The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use\\u2026\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go\\u2026Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I've only learned one Jutsu.\\n He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026\\n until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026?\\n Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I'm impressed you found this place.\\n I see now\\u2026how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don't do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn't you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That's why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why\\u2026?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn't a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn't that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026.\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.\\n Don't make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I'll take care of you later!\\n I-I won't let you\\u2026\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There's a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens\\u2026\\n I've found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can't be\\u2026\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How\\u2026\\n did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026?\\n Because I'm Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster\\u2026\\n that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You're right\\u2026\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me\\u2026\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You've\\u2026\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What's this\\u2026?\\n What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon!\\n Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that case\\u2026 I'll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He's really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders\\u2026\\n Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be bad\\u2026\\n There's no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He'll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulations\\u2026on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja.\\n But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand\\u2026\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You're smaller than me and\\n you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not.\\n It's not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \\\"My Name Is Konohamaru!\\\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

You're asking for it!\\n I like stuff like this!\\n A Jonin wouldn't get caught in such a weak booby trap.\\n That's right. You're such an idiot...!\\n I got him, I got him...\\n I-I'm sorry, sir.\\n I tried to stop him, but Naruto did it on his own...\\n It's all good.\\n Get real. ls he really a Jonin?\\n How can I put this?\\n As for my first impression of you guys...?\\n Well, I hate you.\\n Pass or Fail: Survival Test\\n Let's see.\\n First off, let me have you guys introduce yourselves.\\n Introduce ourselves...\\n What should we say?\\n Your likes, dislikes, your future dream, hobbies, things like that!\\n Hey!  Before that, please tell us about yourself.\\n Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.\\n I don't feel like telling you guys about my likes and dislikes.\\n I've never really thought about my future dream...\\n As for my hobbies, I have many.\\n In the end, isn't all we know his name?\\n Yeah.\\n Next is you guys.\\n Let's start with you.\\n My name's Naruto Uzumaki!\\n I like instant ramen,\\n but what I like even more is the ramen from Ichiraku\\n that Iruka Sensei treats me to.\\n What I dislike is the three minutes\\n after pouring hot water in the instant ramen.\\n My hobby is eating and comparing ramen!\\n And my future dream...\\n is to surpass the Hokage!\\n And so I'm going to get the entire village\\n to acknowledge my existence!\\n I see...\\n this kid's grown up in an interesting way.\\n Okay, next.\\n I'm Sakura Haruno.\\n What I like... I mean, who I like is...\\n And, my hobby is, \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI mean...\\n My future dream is...\\n And? What about your dislikes?\\n Naruto!\\n Girls at her age are probably more interested in love\\n than the Ninja Arts.\\n And lastly.\\n My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.\\n I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular.\\n Oh...\\n And...\\n I don't feel like summing up my ambition as just a dream\\n but I do have an ambition!\\n The ambition to restore my clan and without fail...\\n to kill a certain man!\\n He doesn't...\\n mean me, does he?\\n Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.\\n I knew it...\\n Good!\\n The three of you are very distinctive and interesting!\\n We'll have a mission tomorrow!\\n Yes, sir! What kind of mission?\\n First, we'll do what we can do with just four people.\\n What-what-what?!\\n A survival exercise.\\n Survival exercise?\\n Why are we doing an exercise\\n even though this is supposed to be a mission?\\n We've had more than our share of exercises in the Academy!\\n This is no simple exercise.\\n Then... then what kind of exercise is it?\\n Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?\\n Uh, well, if I tell you, I know you'll grow disenchanted.\\n What?\\n Of the twenty-seven graduates,\\n only nine will be recognized as junior ninjas.\\n The remaining eighteen will be sent back to the Academy.\\n In other words, this exercise is an extremely difficult test\\n with a failure rate of 66% or higher!\\n See, see?\\n You got disenchanted!\\n That's crazy!\\n To have suffered that much!\\n T-Then, what was the graduation test for?\\n Oh, that.\\n It was just to select those who have the potential of becoming Genin.\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Well, that's the way it is.\\n I'll be determining whether you pass or fail.\\n Bring your complete set of Ninja tools!\\n We meet at five in the morning.\\n N-No way am I going to be dropped now!\\n I've got to have my strength recognized for real.\\n I'll be separated from Sasuke if I fail this test.\\n This is an exercise of love!\\n Okay! You're dismissed.\\n Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.\\n You'll throw up.\\n Morning.\\n Hi, folks. Good morning!\\n You're late!\\n Well, a black cat crossed my path, you see.\\n Ahem! Oh well...\\n Okay, it's set for 12:00!\\n Today's assignment is to take these bells away from me by noon.\\n Those who can't do it won't get lunch.\\n They'll be tied to that...\\n and I'll eat my lunch before your very eyes.\\n So that was the point...\\n for us not to eat breakfast...\\n But, hold on.\\n Why are there only two bells?\\n There are only two, so at the very least,\\n one will have to go to the logs.\\n That person will be disqualified for failing the mission...\\n and will return to the Academy.\\n It might be one person at the very least,\\n or it could be all three of you.\\n You can use your Shuriken.\\n You won't be able to take the bells unless you come with the intent to kill me.\\n But, that's dangerous, sir!\\n Y-Yeah, that's right!\\n You couldn't even evade a chalkboard eraser!\\n In this world,\\n those who aren't skilled enough tend to complain more.\\n Well, just ignore the loser...\\n Begin when I give the \\\"ready-go\\\" signal.\\n Loser, loser, loser.\\n Don't be so hasty. I didn't say start, yet.\\n No way...!\\n I didn't see him at all.\\n So this is a Jonin.\\n But, that's fine.\\n At least you came with  the intent to kill me.\\n How can I put this...?\\n I feel like I'm finally starting...\\n to like you guys.\\n We're going to start.\\n Ready... start!\\n What do you want to know?\\n I didn't think you just came here to drink tea.\\n The Jonin in Naruto and company's Group Seven...\\n What kind of teacher is he? ls he strict?\\n You mean Kakashi? Does he concern you?\\n I heard a rumor that concerns me.\\n What's this?\\n It's a pass-fail list of the junior ninjas\\n Kakashi has been in charge of up until now.\\n Let me have a look.\\n T-This is...!\\n Fundamentally, ninja must mask their presence and hide.\\n Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...\\n Alright! Let's face off fair and square!\\n Oh?\\n That goof.\\n Say, aren't you a bit off kilter?\\n What's off kilter is your hairstyle!\\n I'll teach you the first Shinobi Battle Jutsu...\\n Taijutsu.\\n Taijutsu...?\\n That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...\\n That being said... he's going to use weapons?\\n Make-Out Paradise\\n What's the matter?\\n Why don't you come at me?\\n But hey... what's with the book?\\n Why do you ask...?\\n It's because I was curious about what happens next.\\n Don't worry.\\n With you guys as opponents,\\n it makes no difference if I'm reading or not.\\n I'm going to rip you apart!\\n Darn! This time a spin kick!\\n Man!\\n Wha--?!\\n Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind multiple times, fool.\\n The way his hands are positioned...\\n Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!\\n No way!\\n With Naruto as his opponent,\\n that's too strong a Ninjutsu no matter how you look at it.\\n That Sign... lt's a fire-style skill.\\n That idiot teacher's doing more than just running around?\\n Naruto, get out of there quick!\\n You'll die!\\n Too late.\\n Leaf Village Secret! Ultimate Taijutsu!\\n One Thousand Years of Death!\\n Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.\\n Those two are idiots.\\n Alright...\\n Even so, isn't that against the rules?\\n What're we supposed to do about his strength?\\n Darn it!\\n It wasn't supposed to be like this.\\n It... can't be!\\n This is more than just a rumor.\\n Kakashi's test might be a bit difficult...\\n Even so, this means absolutely no one has passed...!\\n That's right...\\n Kakashi has never had someone pass.\\n They have all...\\n been annihilated...\\n What's the matter?\\n You won't get lunch if you can't take the bell by noon.\\n I know that, I say.\\n You're not very energetic,\\n considering you said that you'd surpass the Hokage.\\n Darn it! Darn it! I can fight even if I'm hungry.\\n I didn't even have dinner last night.\\n I shouldn't have gone on a diet.\\n I just got a bit careless earlier!\\n Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...\\n But... I've got to take the bell, no matter what.\\n No matter what...\\n I'm... not...\\n turning back now!\\n I'm going to become a Ninja!\\n Security is your greatest enemy!\\n Now for my favorite Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Seven... Narutos?\\n What? They're not just images?\\n Are they all real? The real thing?\\n Not the clone, but the shadow clone, eh.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones!\\n That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n It's the forbidden Jutsu that did in Mizuki.\\n Judging from your ability,\\n that Jutsu should have a one-minute limit.\\n Even if you talk trash,\\n Naruto is Naruto after all is said and done...\\n You still can't beat me with that skill.\\n W-What?! Behind me?!\\n Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind.\\n Right, Kakashi Sensei?\\n Using the Shadow Clone,\\n I had one of them come up\\n from the bottom of the river and sneak behind you!\\n Here's one for that attack on my butt earlier!\\n Naruto, not bad!\\n So... a diversionary tactic, eh?\\n Now... allow me to punch you!\\n What?!\\n The one who got punched was...\\n Naruto?\\n Ouch!\\n You...!\\n You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!\\n You used the Transformation Jutsu to change yourself, didn't you?!\\n It's you!\\n You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.\\n You smell like Kakashi Sensei!\\n The smell of an old guy!\\n Why you--!\\n Hey! For the time being, let's try undoing the Jutsu.\\n If we do that, only the two will remain... so...\\n You should've realized that sooner, you idiot!\\n You're me, you idiot! Just undo the Jutsu!\\n Naruto...\\n You're embarrassing to watch...\\n That was the Substitution Jutsu, you fool.\\n Essentially, it's a skill used to quickly switch one's own body\\n with an object or animal.\\n This makes your enemy think you're being attacked,\\n but then you strike during their unguarded moment.\\n After letting himself get caught by the real Naruto,\\n the Jonin fool switched bodies with one of the clone Narutos.\\n Not only did he make Naruto think he'd been nailed...\\n he used Naruto's own attack on him.\\n A bell?!\\n You really must have been in a hurry.\\n You've dropped a bell!\\n What the heck is this?!\\n Of course it's a trap...\\n H-H-Hey!\\n That jonin doesn't lower his guard even when he's fighting Naruto.\\n The bell!\\n You have to think when using Jutsu.\\n They can be used against you.\\n Also...\\n ...don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool.\\n A Ninja must see through deception!\\n I know that, I say!\\n You know, I'm telling you because you don't get it.\\n Listen up!\\n Your movements are wasteful.\\n Now!\\n He finally dropped his guard!\\n You're so...\\n No way!\\n You jerk Sasuke!\\n You're overdoing it!\\n Darn it!\\n At this rate, there's no way I can beat Kakashi Sensei.\\n But if I don't take the bell...\\n I won't get lunch...\\n No... I'll fail the test!\\n He says a Ninja must see through deception,\\n but I have no idea what that means.\\n How in the world can I take the bell back\\n from Kakashi Sensei?!\\n Next episode:  \\\"You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision\\\"\\n Don't miss my outstanding performance!\\n\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.\\n With its powerful tails,\\n it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.\\n A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.\\n We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!\\n We can't let it get any closer to our village!\\n One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,\\n but died in the process.\\n This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage.\\n Naruto!\\n Why did you do such a thing?!\\n You're really gonna get it this time!\\n I don't care!\\n You know your problem?\\n You can't do the things I do!\\n Only I can do this!\\n I'm better than all of you! Believe it!\\n There's a problem, sir!\\n Lord Hokage!\\n What is it?\\n Did that Naruto do something again?\\n Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images\\u2026\\n And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!\\n Wait!\\n Ha ha\\u2026\\n Why should I?\\n Hey, Naruto!\\n How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?\\n The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?\\n Now listen, Naruto.\\n You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.\\n This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!\\n We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!\\n Even those who already passed will take it!\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Sakura Haruno.

Stop making idiotic spells!\\n Darn\\u2026\\n Darn\\u2026\\n I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up.\\n I don't care\\u2026\\n There's nobody home anyway.\\n Naruto...\\n What is it this time?\\n What I meant was\\u2026\\n If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight.\\n Huh?!\\n Yes! I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I'll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will\\u2026\\n You're so mean!\\n So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no\\u2026\\n Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn't that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.\\n I 'm a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That's my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I'll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026\\n Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don't have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026\\n I'll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But\\u2026\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What's the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let's see\\u2026\\n The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use\\u2026\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go\\u2026Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I've only learned one Jutsu.\\n He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026\\n until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026?\\n Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I'm impressed you found this place.\\n I see now\\u2026how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don't do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn't you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That's why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why\\u2026?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn't a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn't that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026.\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.\\n Don't make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I'll take care of you later!\\n I-I won't let you\\u2026\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There's a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens\\u2026\\n I've found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can't be\\u2026\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How\\u2026\\n did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026?\\n Because I'm Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster\\u2026\\n that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You're right\\u2026\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me\\u2026\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You've\\u2026\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What's this\\u2026?\\n What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon!\\n Weren't you gonna get me with one blow?

Before that, please tell us about yourself.\\n Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.\\n I don't feel like telling you guys about my likes and dislikes.\\n I've never really thought about my future dream...\\n As for my hobbies, I have many.\\n In the end, isn't all we know his name?\\n Yeah.\\n Next is you guys.\\n Let's start with you.\\n My name's Naruto Uzumaki!\\n I like instant ramen,\\n but what I like even more is the ramen from Ichiraku\\n that Iruka Sensei treats me to.\\n What I dislike is the three minutes\\n after pouring hot water in the instant ramen.\\n My hobby is eating and comparing ramen!\\n And my future dream...\\n is to surpass the Hokage!\\n And so I'm going to get the entire village\\n to acknowledge my existence!\\n I see...\\n this kid's grown up in an interesting way.\\n Okay, next.\\n I'm Sakura Haruno.\\n What I like... I mean, who I like is...\\n And, my hobby is, \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI mean...\\n My future dream is...\\n And? What about your dislikes?\\n Naruto!\\n Girls at her age are probably more interested in love\\n than the Ninja Arts.\\n And lastly.\\n My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.\\n I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular.\\n Oh...\\n And...\\n I don't feel like summing up my ambition as just a dream\\n but I do have an ambition!\\n The ambition to restore my clan and without fail...\\n to kill a certain man!\\n He doesn't...\\n mean me, does he?\\n Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.\\n I knew it...\\n Good!\\n The three of you are very distinctive and interesting!\\n We'll have a mission tomorrow!\\n Yes, sir! What kind of mission?\\n First, we'll do what we can do with just four people.\\n What-what-what?!\\n A survival exercise.\\n Survival exercise?\\n Why are we doing an exercise\\n even though this is supposed to be a mission?\\n We've had more than our share of exercises in the Academy!\\n This is no simple exercise.\\n Then... then what kind of exercise is it?\\n Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?\\n Uh, well, if I tell you, I know you'll grow disenchanted.\\n What?\\n Of the twenty-seven graduates,\\n only nine will be recognized as junior ninjas.\\n The remaining eighteen will be sent back to the Academy.\\n In other words, this exercise is an extremely difficult test\\n with a failure rate of 66% or higher!\\n See, see?\\n You got disenchanted!\\n That's crazy!\\n To have suffered that much!\\n T-Then, what was the graduation test for?\\n Oh, that.\\n It was just to select those who have the potential of becoming Genin.\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Well, that's the way it is.\\n I'll be determining whether you pass or fail.\\n Bring your complete set of Ninja tools!\\n We meet at five in the morning.\\n N-No way am I going to be dropped now!\\n I've got to have my strength recognized for real.\\n I'll be separated from Sasuke if I fail this test.\\n This is an exercise of love!\\n Okay! You're dismissed.\\n Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.\\n You'll throw up.\\n Morning.\\n Hi, folks. Good morning!\\n You're late!\\n Well, a black cat crossed my path, you see.\\n Ahem! Oh well...\\n Okay, it's set for 12:00!\\n Today's assignment is to take these bells away from me by noon.\\n Those who can't do it won't get lunch.\\n They'll be tied to that...\\n and I'll eat my lunch before your very eyes.\\n So that was the point...\\n for us not to eat breakfast...\\n But, hold on.\\n Why are there only two bells?\\n There are only two, so at the very least,\\n one will have to go to the logs.\\n That person will be disqualified for failing the mission...\\n and will return to the Academy.\\n It might be one person at the very least,\\n or it could be all three of you.\\n You can use your Shuriken.\\n You won't be able to take the bells unless you come with the intent to kill me.\\n But, that's dangerous, sir!\\n Y-Yeah, that's right!\\n You couldn't even evade a chalkboard eraser!\\n In this world,\\n those who aren't skilled enough tend to complain more.\\n Well, just ignore the loser...\\n Begin when I give the \\\"ready-go\\\" signal.\\n Loser, loser, loser.\\n Don't be so hasty. I didn't say start, yet.\\n No way...!\\n I didn't see him at all.\\n So this is a Jonin.\\n But, that's fine.\\n At least you came with  the intent to kill me.\\n How can I put this...?\\n I feel like I'm finally starting...\\n to like you guys.\\n We're going to start.\\n Ready... start!\\n What do you want to know?\\n I didn't think you just came here to drink tea.\\n The Jonin in Naruto and company's Group Seven...\\n What kind of teacher is he? ls he strict?\\n You mean Kakashi? Does he concern you?\\n I heard a rumor that concerns me.\\n What's this?\\n It's a pass-fail list of the junior ninjas\\n Kakashi has been in charge of up until now.\\n Let me have a look.\\n T-This is...!\\n Fundamentally, ninja must mask their presence and hide.\\n Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...\\n Alright! Let's face off fair and square!\\n Oh?\\n That goof.\\n Say, aren't you a bit off kilter?\\n What's off kilter is your hairstyle!\\n I'll teach you the first Shinobi Battle Jutsu...\\n Taijutsu.\\n Taijutsu...?\\n That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...\\n That being said... he's going to use weapons?\\n Make-Out Paradise\\n What's the matter?\\n Why don't you come at me?\\n But hey... what's with the book?\\n Why do you ask...?\\n It's because I was curious about what happens next.\\n Don't worry.\\n With you guys as opponents,\\n it makes no difference if I'm reading or not.\\n I'm going to rip you apart!\\n Darn! This time a spin kick!\\n Man!\\n Wha--?!\\n Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind multiple times, fool.\\n The way his hands are positioned...\\n Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!\\n No way!\\n With Naruto as his opponent,\\n that's too strong a Ninjutsu no matter how you look at it.\\n That Sign... lt's a fire-style skill.\\n That idiot teacher's doing more than just running around?\\n Naruto, get out of there quick!\\n You'll die!\\n Too late.\\n Leaf Village Secret! Ultimate Taijutsu!\\n One Thousand Years of Death!\\n Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.\\n Those two are idiots.\\n Alright...\\n Even so, isn't that against the rules?\\n What're we supposed to do about his strength?\\n Darn it!\\n It wasn't supposed to be like this.\\n It... can't be!\\n This is more than just a rumor.\\n Kakashi's test might be a bit difficult...\\n Even so, this means absolutely no one has passed...!\\n That's right...\\n Kakashi has never had someone pass.\\n They have all...\\n been annihilated...\\n What's the matter?\\n You won't get lunch if you can't take the bell by noon.\\n I know that, I say.\\n You're not very energetic,\\n considering you said that you'd surpass the Hokage.\\n Darn it! Darn it! I can fight even if I'm hungry.\\n I didn't even have dinner last night.\\n I shouldn't have gone on a diet.\\n I just got a bit careless earlier!\\n Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...\\n But... I've got to take the bell, no matter what.\\n No matter what...\\n I'm... not...\\n turning back now!\\n I'm going to become a Ninja!\\n Security is your greatest enemy!\\n Now for my favorite Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Seven... Narutos?\\n What? They're not just images?\\n Are they all real? The real thing?\\n Not the clone, but the shadow clone, eh.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones!\\n That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n It's the forbidden Jutsu that did in Mizuki.\\n Judging from your ability,\\n that Jutsu should have a one-minute limit.\\n Even if you talk trash,\\n Naruto is Naruto after all is said and done...\\n You still can't beat me with that skill.\\n W-What?! Behind me?!\\n Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind.\\n Right, Kakashi Sensei?\\n Using the Shadow Clone,\\n I had one of them come up\\n from the bottom of the river and sneak behind you!\\n Here's one for that attack on my butt earlier!\\n Naruto, not bad!\\n So... a diversionary tactic, eh?\\n Now... allow me to punch you!\\n What?!\\n The one who got punched was...\\n Naruto?\\n Ouch!\\n You...!\\n You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!\\n You used the Transformation Jutsu to change yourself, didn't you?!\\n It's you!\\n You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.\\n You smell like Kakashi Sensei!\\n The smell of an old guy!\\n Why you--!\\n Hey! For the time being, let's try undoing the Jutsu.\\n If we do that, only the two will remain... so...\\n You should've realized that sooner, you idiot!\\n You're me, you idiot! Just undo the Jutsu!\\n Naruto...\\n You're embarrassing to watch...\\n That was the Substitution Jutsu, you fool.\\n Essentially, it's a skill used to quickly switch one's own body\\n with an object or animal.\\n This makes your enemy think you're being attacked,\\n but then you strike during their unguarded moment.\\n After letting himself get caught by the real Naruto,\\n the Jonin fool switched bodies with one of the clone Narutos.\\n Not only did he make Naruto think he'd been nailed...\\n he used Naruto's own attack on him.\\n A bell?!\\n You really must have been in a hurry.\\n You've dropped a bell!\\n What the heck is this?!\\n Of course it's a trap...\\n H-H-Hey!\\n That jonin doesn't lower his guard even when he's fighting Naruto.\\n The bell!\\n You have to think when using Jutsu.\\n They can be used against you.\\n Also...\\n ...don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool.\\n A Ninja must see through deception!\\n I know that, I say!\\n You know, I'm telling you because you don't get it.\\n Listen up!\\n Your movements are wasteful.\\n Now!\\n He finally dropped his guard!\\n You're so...\\n No way!\\n You jerk Sasuke!\\n You're overdoing it!\\n Darn it!\\n At this rate, there's no way I can beat Kakashi Sensei.\\n But if I don't take the bell...\\n I won't get lunch...\\n No... I'll fail the test!\\n He says a Ninja must see through deception,\\n but I have no idea what that means.\\n How in the world can I take the bell back\\n from Kakashi Sensei?!\\n Next episode:  \\\"You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision\\\"\\n Don't miss my outstanding performance!\\n\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.\\n With its powerful tails,\\n it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.\\n A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.\\n We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!\\n We can't let it get any closer to our village!\\n One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,\\n but died in the process.\\n This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage.\\n Naruto!\\n Why did you do such a thing?!\\n You're really gonna get it this time!\\n I don't care!\\n You know your problem?\\n You can't do the things I do!\\n Only I can do this!\\n I'm better than all of you! Believe it!\\n There's a problem, sir!\\n Lord Hokage!\\n What is it?\\n Did that Naruto do something again?\\n Yes.

Here I go\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n OK!\\n I did it!\\n Cha!\\n Did you see that, Sasuke?\\n Next, Sasuke Uchiha.\\n Yes.\\n O-OK.\\n Next, Naruto Uzumaki.\\n This is a real pain.\\n And it's all your fault.\\n Like I care!!\\n OK\\u2026\\n Good luck, Naruto\\u2026\\n Transform!\\n How was it?\\n I call it the \\\"Sexy Jutsu\\\"!\\n You fool! Stop making idiotic spells!\\n Darn\\u2026\\n Darn\\u2026\\n I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up.\\n I don't care\\u2026\\n There's nobody home anyway.\\n Naruto...\\n What is it this time?\\n What I meant was\\u2026\\n If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight.\\n Huh?!\\n Yes! I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I'll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will\\u2026\\n You're so mean!\\n So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no\\u2026\\n Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn't that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.\\n I 'm a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That's my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I'll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026\\n Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don't have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026\\n I'll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But\\u2026\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What's the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let's see\\u2026\\n The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use\\u2026\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go\\u2026Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I've only learned one Jutsu.\\n He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026\\n until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026?\\n Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I'm impressed you found this place.\\n I see now\\u2026how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don't do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn't you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That's why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why\\u2026?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn't a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn't that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026.\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.\\n Don't make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I'll take care of you later!\\n I-I won't let you\\u2026\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There's a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens\\u2026\\n I've found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can't be\\u2026\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How\\u2026\\n did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026?\\n Because I'm Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster\\u2026\\n that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You're right\\u2026\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me\\u2026\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You've\\u2026\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What's this\\u2026?\\n What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon!\\n Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that case\\u2026 I'll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He's really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders\\u2026\\n Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be bad\\u2026\\n There's no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He'll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulations\\u2026on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja.\\n But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand\\u2026\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You're smaller than me and\\n you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not.\\n It's not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \\\"My Name Is Konohamaru!\\\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dialogue\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.1155535720204088,\n        \"min\": 0.7951258718967438,\n        \"max\": 0.9585433006286621,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.7951258718967438,\n          0.9585433006286621\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"betrayal\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.16828056498641683,\n        \"min\": 0.5547239482402802,\n        \"max\": 0.7927086055278778,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5547239482402802,\n          0.7927086055278778\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"battle\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.02314820824051705,\n        \"min\": 0.7236737310886383,\n        \"max\": 0.7564102411270142,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.7236737310886383,\n          0.7564102411270142\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sacrifice\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.019997130721736443,\n        \"min\": 0.652152493596077,\n        \"max\": 0.6804327070713043,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.652152493596077,\n          0.6804327070713043\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"self development\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.04466706146445145,\n        \"min\": 0.7981592118740082,\n        \"max\": 0.8613279759883881,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8613279759883881,\n          0.7981592118740082\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hope\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.17226719324021378,\n        \"min\": 0.20166896283626556,\n        \"max\": 0.44529156386852264,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.44529156386852264,\n          0.20166896283626556\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"friendship\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.3201177266871266,\n        \"min\": 0.07262833416461945,\n        \"max\": 0.5253431648015976,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5253431648015976,\n          0.07262833416461945\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"love\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.1988326580798265,\n        \"min\": 0.03414126019924879,\n        \"max\": 0.3153331018984318,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.3153331018984318,\n          0.03414126019924879\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

You're asking for it!\\n I like stuff like this!\\n A Jonin wouldn't get caught in such a weak booby trap.\\n That's right. You're such an idiot...!\\n I got him, I got him...\\n I-I'm sorry, sir.\\n I tried to stop him, but Naruto did it on his own...\\n It's all good.\\n Get real. ls he really a Jonin?\\n How can I put this?\\n As for my first impression of you guys...?\\n Well, I hate you.\\n Pass or Fail: Survival Test\\n Let's see.\\n First off, let me have you guys introduce yourselves.\\n Introduce ourselves...\\n What should we say?\\n Your likes, dislikes, your future dream, hobbies, things like that!\\n Hey!  Before that, please tell us about yourself.\\n Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.\\n I don't feel like telling you guys about my likes and dislikes.\\n I've never really thought about my future dream...\\n As for my hobbies, I have many.\\n In the end, isn't all we know his name?\\n Yeah.\\n Next is you guys.\\n Let's start with you.\\n My name's Naruto Uzumaki!\\n I like instant ramen,\\n but what I like even more is the ramen from Ichiraku\\n that Iruka Sensei treats me to.\\n What I dislike is the three minutes\\n after pouring hot water in the instant ramen.\\n My hobby is eating and comparing ramen!\\n And my future dream...\\n is to surpass the Hokage!\\n And so I'm going to get the entire village\\n to acknowledge my existence!\\n I see...\\n this kid's grown up in an interesting way.\\n Okay, next.\\n I'm Sakura Haruno.\\n What I like... I mean, who I like is...\\n And, my hobby is, \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI mean...\\n My future dream is...\\n And? What about your dislikes?\\n Naruto!\\n Girls at her age are probably more interested in love\\n than the Ninja Arts.\\n And lastly.\\n My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.\\n I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular.\\n Oh...\\n And...\\n I don't feel like summing up my ambition as just a dream\\n but I do have an ambition!\\n The ambition to restore my clan and without fail...\\n to kill a certain man!\\n He doesn't...\\n mean me, does he?\\n Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.\\n I knew it...\\n Good!\\n The three of you are very distinctive and interesting!\\n We'll have a mission tomorrow!\\n Yes, sir! What kind of mission?\\n First, we'll do what we can do with just four people.\\n What-what-what?!\\n A survival exercise.\\n Survival exercise?\\n Why are we doing an exercise\\n even though this is supposed to be a mission?\\n We've had more than our share of exercises in the Academy!\\n This is no simple exercise.\\n Then... then what kind of exercise is it?\\n Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?\\n Uh, well, if I tell you, I know you'll grow disenchanted.\\n What?\\n Of the twenty-seven graduates,\\n only nine will be recognized as junior ninjas.\\n The remaining eighteen will be sent back to the Academy.\\n In other words, this exercise is an extremely difficult test\\n with a failure rate of 66% or higher!\\n See, see?\\n You got disenchanted!\\n That's crazy!\\n To have suffered that much!\\n T-Then, what was the graduation test for?\\n Oh, that.\\n It was just to select those who have the potential of becoming Genin.\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Well, that's the way it is.\\n I'll be determining whether you pass or fail.\\n Bring your complete set of Ninja tools!\\n We meet at five in the morning.\\n N-No way am I going to be dropped now!\\n I've got to have my strength recognized for real.\\n I'll be separated from Sasuke if I fail this test.\\n This is an exercise of love!\\n Okay! You're dismissed.\\n Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.\\n You'll throw up.\\n Morning.\\n Hi, folks. Good morning!\\n You're late!\\n Well, a black cat crossed my path, you see.\\n Ahem! Oh well...\\n Okay, it's set for 12:00!\\n Today's assignment is to take these bells away from me by noon.\\n Those who can't do it won't get lunch.\\n They'll be tied to that...\\n and I'll eat my lunch before your very eyes.\\n So that was the point...\\n for us not to eat breakfast...\\n But, hold on.\\n Why are there only two bells?\\n There are only two, so at the very least,\\n one will have to go to the logs.\\n That person will be disqualified for failing the mission...\\n and will return to the Academy.\\n It might be one person at the very least,\\n or it could be all three of you.\\n You can use your Shuriken.\\n You won't be able to take the bells unless you come with the intent to kill me.\\n But, that's dangerous, sir!\\n Y-Yeah, that's right!\\n You couldn't even evade a chalkboard eraser!\\n In this world,\\n those who aren't skilled enough tend to complain more.\\n Well, just ignore the loser...\\n Begin when I give the \\\"ready-go\\\" signal.\\n Loser, loser, loser.\\n Don't be so hasty. I didn't say start, yet.\\n No way...!\\n I didn't see him at all.\\n So this is a Jonin.\\n But, that's fine.\\n At least you came with  the intent to kill me.\\n How can I put this...?\\n I feel like I'm finally starting...\\n to like you guys.\\n We're going to start.\\n Ready... start!\\n What do you want to know?\\n I didn't think you just came here to drink tea.\\n The Jonin in Naruto and company's Group Seven...\\n What kind of teacher is he? ls he strict?\\n You mean Kakashi? Does he concern you?\\n I heard a rumor that concerns me.\\n What's this?\\n It's a pass-fail list of the junior ninjas\\n Kakashi has been in charge of up until now.\\n Let me have a look.\\n T-This is...!\\n Fundamentally, ninja must mask their presence and hide.\\n Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...\\n Alright! Let's face off fair and square!\\n Oh?\\n That goof.\\n Say, aren't you a bit off kilter?\\n What's off kilter is your hairstyle!\\n I'll teach you the first Shinobi Battle Jutsu...\\n Taijutsu.\\n Taijutsu...?\\n That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...\\n That being said... he's going to use weapons?\\n Make-Out Paradise\\n What's the matter?\\n Why don't you come at me?\\n But hey... what's with the book?\\n Why do you ask...?\\n It's because I was curious about what happens next.\\n Don't worry.\\n With you guys as opponents,\\n it makes no difference if I'm reading or not.\\n I'm going to rip you apart!\\n Darn! This time a spin kick!\\n Man!\\n Wha--?!\\n Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind multiple times, fool.\\n The way his hands are positioned...\\n Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!\\n No way!\\n With Naruto as his opponent,\\n that's too strong a Ninjutsu no matter how you look at it.\\n That Sign... lt's a fire-style skill.\\n That idiot teacher's doing more than just running around?\\n Naruto, get out of there quick!\\n You'll die!\\n Too late.\\n Leaf Village Secret! Ultimate Taijutsu!\\n One Thousand Years of Death!\\n Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.\\n Those two are idiots.\\n Alright...\\n Even so, isn't that against the rules?\\n What're we supposed to do about his strength?\\n Darn it!\\n It wasn't supposed to be like this.\\n It... can't be!\\n This is more than just a rumor.\\n Kakashi's test might be a bit difficult...\\n Even so, this means absolutely no one has passed...!\\n That's right...\\n Kakashi has never had someone pass.\\n They have all...\\n been annihilated...\\n What's the matter?\\n You won't get lunch if you can't take the bell by noon.\\n I know that, I say.\\n You're not very energetic,\\n considering you said that you'd surpass the Hokage.\\n Darn it! Darn it! I can fight even if I'm hungry.\\n I didn't even have dinner last night.\\n I shouldn't have gone on a diet.\\n I just got a bit careless earlier!\\n Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...\\n But... I've got to take the bell, no matter what.\\n No matter what...\\n I'm... not...\\n turning back now!\\n I'm going to become a Ninja!\\n Security is your greatest enemy!\\n Now for my favorite Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Seven... Narutos?\\n What? They're not just images?\\n Are they all real? The real thing?\\n Not the clone, but the shadow clone, eh.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones!\\n That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n It's the forbidden Jutsu that did in Mizuki.\\n Judging from your ability,\\n that Jutsu should have a one-minute limit.\\n Even if you talk trash,\\n Naruto is Naruto after all is said and done...\\n You still can't beat me with that skill.\\n W-What?! Behind me?!\\n Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind.\\n Right, Kakashi Sensei?\\n Using the Shadow Clone,\\n I had one of them come up\\n from the bottom of the river and sneak behind you!\\n Here's one for that attack on my butt earlier!\\n Naruto, not bad!\\n So... a diversionary tactic, eh?\\n Now... allow me to punch you!\\n What?!\\n The one who got punched was...\\n Naruto?\\n Ouch!\\n You...!\\n You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!\\n You used the Transformation Jutsu to change yourself, didn't you?!\\n It's you!\\n You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.\\n You smell like Kakashi Sensei!\\n The smell of an old guy!\\n Why you--!\\n Hey! For the time being, let's try undoing the Jutsu.\\n If we do that, only the two will remain... so...\\n You should've realized that sooner, you idiot!\\n You're me, you idiot! Just undo the Jutsu!\\n Naruto...\\n You're embarrassing to watch...\\n That was the Substitution Jutsu, you fool.\\n Essentially, it's a skill used to quickly switch one's own body\\n with an object or animal.\\n This makes your enemy think you're being attacked,\\n but then you strike during their unguarded moment.\\n After letting himself get caught by the real Naruto,\\n the Jonin fool switched bodies with one of the clone Narutos.\\n Not only did he make Naruto think he'd been nailed...\\n he used Naruto's own attack on him.\\n A bell?!\\n You really must have been in a hurry.\\n You've dropped a bell!\\n What the heck is this?!\\n Of course it's a trap...\\n H-H-Hey!\\n That jonin doesn't lower his guard even when he's fighting Naruto.\\n The bell!\\n You have to think when using Jutsu.\\n They can be used against you.\\n Also...\\n ...don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool.\\n A Ninja must see through deception!\\n I know that, I say!\\n You know, I'm telling you because you don't get it.\\n Listen up!\\n Your movements are wasteful.\\n Now!\\n He finally dropped his guard!\\n You're so...\\n No way!\\n You jerk Sasuke!\\n You're overdoing it!\\n Darn it!\\n At this rate, there's no way I can beat Kakashi Sensei.\\n But if I don't take the bell...\\n I won't get lunch...\\n No... I'll fail the test!\\n He says a Ninja must see through deception,\\n but I have no idea what that means.\\n How in the world can I take the bell back\\n from Kakashi Sensei?!\\n Next episode:  \\\"You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision\\\"\\n Don't miss my outstanding performance!\\n\",\n          \"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.\\n With its powerful tails,\\n it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.\\n A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.\\n We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!\\n We can't let it get any closer to our village!\\n One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,\\n but died in the process.\\n This Ninja was known as\\u2026 the Fourth Hokage.\\n Naruto!\\n Why did you do such a thing?!\\n You're really gonna get it this time!\\n I don't care!\\n You know your problem?\\n You can't do the things I do!\\n Only I can do this!\\n I'm better than all of you! Believe it!\\n There's a problem, sir!\\n Lord Hokage!\\n What is it?\\n Did that Naruto do something again?\\n Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images\\u2026\\n And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!\\n Wait!\\n Ha ha\\u2026\\n Why should I?\\n Hey, Naruto!\\n How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?\\n The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?\\n Now listen, Naruto.\\n You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.\\n This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!\\n We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!\\n Even those who already passed will take it!\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Sakura Haruno.

Stop making idiotic spells!\\n Darn\\u2026\\n Darn\\u2026\\n I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up.\\n I don't care\\u2026\\n There's nobody home anyway.\\n Naruto...\\n What is it this time?\\n What I meant was\\u2026\\n If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight.\\n Huh?!\\n Yes! I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I'll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm\\u2026No\\u2026\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will\\u2026\\n You're so mean!\\n So that's why you took off your goggles\\u2026\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no\\u2026\\n Of all the\\u2026! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But still\\u2026 I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn't that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.\\n I 'm a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That's my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I'll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn't that the boy who is actually\\u2026\\n Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don't have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice\\u2026\\n I'll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But\\u2026\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents\\u2026like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What's the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto\\u2026 stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let's see\\u2026\\n The first Jutsu is\\u2026 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use\\u2026\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go\\u2026Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto\\u2026\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I've only learned one Jutsu.\\n He's been practicing the Jutsu\\u2026\\n until he's become this exhausted and dirty\\u2026?\\n Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place\\u2026\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I'm impressed you found this place.\\n I see now\\u2026how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait\\u2026 What's going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don't do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn't you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto\\u2026\\n Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That's why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why\\u2026?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn't a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown\\u2026 because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn't that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely\\u2026right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I'm sorry, Naruto\\u2026.\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.\\n Don't make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No\\u2026 Naruto\\u2026isn't\\u2026like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I'll take care of you later!\\n I-I won't let you\\u2026\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There's a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens\\u2026\\n I've found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can't be\\u2026\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How\\u2026\\n did you know I wasn't Iruka\\u2026?\\n Because I'm Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster\\u2026\\n that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You're right\\u2026\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me\\u2026\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You've\\u2026\\n Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What's this\\u2026?\\n What's the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC'mon!\\n Weren't you gonna get me with one blow?
